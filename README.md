# Colour Characterisation in Optical See-Through Augmented Reality
This repository contains the main codes used for the thesis project titled "Exploring Colours in Optical See-Through Augmented Reality" as a part of the Erasmus Mundus COSI master's programme  
 
"Classical Methods (Matrix and Polynomial Regression)" folder contains the MATLAB scripts for the matrix + LUT method and the polynomial regression method of characterisation.  

"DL Model for characterisation" folder contains the python script of the model that performs characterisation. This is a novel approach introduced in the thesis.  

"Psychophysical Experiments" folder contains C# code for the 2AFC experiment (ColourPatch_Compare.cs) and the Just noticeable difference experiment (JND.cs), as well as a code (AutoTester.cs) to automate the 2AFC experiment on Unity for testing purposes.
